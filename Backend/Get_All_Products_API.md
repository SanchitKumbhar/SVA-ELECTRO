üìù Notes

    productcategory values are stored as choices (e.g., '1', '2'). Consider mapping these codes to human-readable values on the frontend.

    The productimg path can be converted to a full URL using your domain (e.g., http://localhost:8000/media/productimg/...).

    You can add pagination or filtering if the list grows large.
